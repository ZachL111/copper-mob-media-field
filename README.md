# copper-mob-media-field

`copper-mob-media-field` explores mobile workflows in Go. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Copper Mob Media Field Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Why This Exists

The goal is to capture the core behavior in code and make the surrounding assumptions obvious. A reader should be able to run the verifier, open the fixtures, and understand why each decision was made.

## Feature Notes

- Models local state with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep sync pressure changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for form constraints, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents offline paths tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Implementation Notes

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps local state, sync pressure, and form constraints in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 173, with risk penalty 6, latency penalty 2, and weight bonus 4. The Go layout uses small packages and table-oriented tests so the behavior stays easy to follow.

## Code Tour

- `policy`: Go package with the core model
- `cmd`: small command entry point
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `go.mod`: Go module metadata

## Local Setup

The only required setup is the local Go toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Example Scenarios

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Boundaries

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Roadmap

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more mobile workflows fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
